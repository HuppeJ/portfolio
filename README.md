### Other University Project    

I have worked on many other relevant AI and data science projects. Those projects do not have a detailed description in this portfolio because I wanted to keep the portfolio short. Here is a list of some of those projects : 

- Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch using Julia to predict the type of transport used by a Montrealer. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/portfolio/blob/master/projects/Naive_Bayes.ipynb). 
- Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network with backpropagation from scratch using Python and evaluated the implementation with Fashion MNIST dataset. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/portfolio/blob/master/projects/MLP_NN.ipynb).
- Implemented the Encoder and Decoder Deep LSTM architecture with Attention presented in [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Tranlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025) and analysed the results. The source code can he found [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/TraductionAutomatiqueNeuronaleBaseeSurLAttention/blob/master/Luong_Attention_Code_Source.ipynb) and the analysis [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/TraductionAutomatiqueNeuronaleBaseeSurLAttention/blob/master/rapport.pdf).
