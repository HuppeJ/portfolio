### Other Projects

I have worked on many other relevant AI and data science projects. Those projects do not have a detailed description in this portfolio because I wanted to keep the portfolio short. Here is a list of some of those projects : 

#### Naive Bayes Classifier

Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch using Julia to predict the type of transport used by a Montrealer. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/portfolio/blob/master/projects/Naive_Bayes.ipynb). 

#### Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network with Backpropagation

Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network with backpropagation from scratch using Python and evaluated the implementation with Fashion MNIST dataset. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/portfolio/blob/master/projects/MLP_NN.ipynb).

#### Encoder and Decoder Deep LSTM Architecture with Attention

Implemented the Encoder and Decoder Deep LSTM architecture with Attention presented in [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025) using TensorFlow 2 and analyzed the results. The source code can he found [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/TraductionAutomatiqueNeuronaleBaseeSurLAttention/blob/master/Luong_Attention_Code_Source.ipynb) and the analysis [here](https://github.com/HuppeJ/TraductionAutomatiqueNeuronaleBaseeSurLAttention/blob/master/rapport.pdf).

### UML Multi-user Editor ꞏ University 3rd Year Team Project

![](images/uml_multi_user_editor.gif)

Timeline : Jan. to May 2019 <br/>
Type of application : Android Application. <br/>
Technologies used : Typescript, Kotlin, Node.js, Socket.io, Google CLoud Platform's App Engine and Datastore. <br/>
Source code :  [UML-Multi-User-Editor](https://github.com/HuppeJ/UML-Multi-User-Editor). <br/>
Description :

-	Built the server-side application for managing multi-user interactions and data persistence with Node.js and Socket.io. Maintained the server application and database on Google Cloud Platform throughout the hole project.
-	Developed multi-user interaction features for the Android application using Kotlin.
-	Created a project plan for the three teams of two persons: Server Team, Android Team and Desktop Team. Estimated development time of each feature for each team and created a schedule detailing the deadline of each feature.

### Other Projects

#### Beat Tracking of Music Recording

Explained to my classmates the principles of music beat tracking by detailing the Novelty curve, the Fourier Tempogram and the Predominant Local Pulse (PLP) concepts. Broke down into snippets of codes each step needed to find the PLP of a music recording using Python. The notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NvOjQKgj_7n2x9ZkKV7c96XJlkyDVwWZ?usp=sharing).

#### Panorama Construction

Panorama construction by registration, key-points, descriptors and homography. Created a panorama construction algorithm based on Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature detection algorithm.
